# Implementation Summary - Batch Processing, Filtering & Database

## Overview

This update implements three major improvements:
1. **Batch AI Processing** using Gemini's large context window (1M tokens)
2. **Repository Filtering** to only show relevant repos
3. **Database Storage** to cache data and avoid refetching

## 1. Batch Processing with Gemini's Large Context Window

### What Changed
- Added `analyzeContributionImpactBatch()` method in `AIAnalysisService`
- Processes ALL artifacts in a single API call instead of individual calls
- Uses Gemini's 1M token context window to analyze thousands of artifacts at once

### Benefits
- **Faster**: Single API call instead of hundreds/thousands
- **More Efficient**: Better use of Gemini's capabilities
- **Cost Effective**: Fewer API calls = lower costs

### Implementation
- `scoringEngine.ts` now pre-computes batch analysis before calculating scores
- Results are cached in memory during scoring calculation
- Falls back to individual calls for non-Gemini providers

## 2. Repository Filtering

### What Changed
- Updated `artifactIngestion.ts` to filter repositories intelligently
- Only includes:
  1. **Owned Repositories**: Repos where `owner.login === username`
  2. **Forked Repositories**: Only if user has authored PRs in them

### Filtering Logic
```typescript
// Owned repos - always included
const ownedRepos = allRepos.filter(repo => repo.owner.login === username);

// Forked repos - only if user has PRs
const forkedRepos = allRepos.filter(repo => repo.fork === true);
// Then check if user has PRs in each forked repo
```

### Commits & PRs Filtering
- **Commits**: Only includes commits where `author.login === username`
- **PRs**: Only includes PRs where `user.login === username`

## 3. Database Storage (SQLite)

### What Changed
- Created `database.ts` service using `better-sqlite3`
- Database stored at `backend/data/powr.db`
- Tables: `users`, `artifacts`, `profiles`

### Database Schema
```sql
users:
  - username (PRIMARY KEY)
  - github_id
  - access_token_encrypted
  - last_updated
  - created_at

artifacts:
  - id (PRIMARY KEY)
  - username
  - type (repo/commit/pull_request)
  - data (JSON)
  - timestamp
  - repository_owner
  - repository_name
  - created_at

profiles:
  - username (PRIMARY KEY)
  - profile_data (JSON)
  - artifacts_count
  - last_analyzed
  - created_at
  - updated_at
```

### Caching Strategy
- **Profiles**: Cached for 24 hours (configurable)
- **Artifacts**: Cached until next fetch
- **Routes**: Check database first, only fetch if:
  - No cached data exists
  - Cached data is older than 24 hours
  - User explicitly requests refresh

### API Behavior
- `/api/user/profile`: Returns cached profile if < 24 hours old
- `/api/user/artifacts`: Returns cached artifacts if available
- Both endpoints still accept `access_token` for fresh fetches

## Files Modified

1. **backend/src/services/database.ts** (NEW)
   - Database service with SQLite
   - User, artifact, and profile management

2. **backend/src/services/githubService.ts**
   - Added `owner` and `fork` fields to `GitHubRepo` interface

3. **backend/src/services/artifactIngestion.ts**
   - Added repository filtering logic
   - Only includes owned repos or forked repos with user's PRs
   - Filters commits and PRs by author

4. **backend/src/services/aiAnalysis.ts**
   - Added `analyzeContributionImpactBatch()` method
   - Uses Gemini's large context window for batch processing

5. **backend/src/services/scoringEngine.ts**
   - Pre-computes batch impact analysis
   - Caches results in memory during scoring
   - Reuses cached results for all skill calculations

6. **backend/src/routes/user.ts**
   - Checks database before fetching from GitHub
   - Saves artifacts and profiles to database
   - Returns cached data when available

7. **backend/package.json**
   - Added `better-sqlite3` and `@types/better-sqlite3`

8. **.gitignore**
   - Added `data/` directory to ignore database files

## Performance Improvements

### Before
- Individual AI calls for each artifact (could be 1000+ calls)
- Refetched all data on every login
- No filtering of irrelevant repos

### After
- Single batch AI call for all artifacts
- Cached data returned instantly (if < 24 hours old)
- Only relevant repos shown (owned + forked with PRs)

## Usage

### First Time Login
1. User logs in with GitHub
2. System fetches all repos, commits, PRs
3. Filters to only owned repos + forked repos with user's PRs
4. Batch processes all artifacts with Gemini (single API call)
5. Calculates scores
6. Saves everything to database

### Subsequent Logins (< 24 hours)
1. User logs in
2. System checks database
3. Returns cached profile instantly
4. No GitHub API calls, no AI processing

### Refresh Profile
- User can click "Refresh Analysis" to force fresh fetch
- Or wait 24 hours for automatic refresh

## Database Location

- **Path**: `backend/data/powr.db`
- **Type**: SQLite (file-based, no server needed)
- **Backup**: Database file can be copied/backed up easily

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Add encryption for access tokens in database
2. Add migration system for schema changes
3. Add database indexes for faster queries
4. Add cleanup job for old artifacts
5. Add database backup/restore functionality
